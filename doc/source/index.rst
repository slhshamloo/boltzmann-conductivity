elecBoltz documentation
=======================

*elecBoltz* is a Python package for simulating electron transport in materials by solving the
Boltzmann equation using a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. It is designed to be easy to
use and flexible, allowing for various different types of materials and scattering models.

In addition to the usual relaxation time approximation in the Chambers formula (see for
example, `this package <https://github.com/gaelgrissonnanche/cuprates_transport>`_), this
package can also handle more complex scattering models with an arbitrary kernel.

The package is developed and maintained by the `Grissonnanche Group
<https://gaelgrissonnanche.com/>`_ at `Laboratoire de Solides Irradiés (LSI)
<https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lsi/fr.html>`_ at École Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France.
